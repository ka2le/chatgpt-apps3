CHARACTER PROFILE: Enzo "Ez" Bianchi

1. Speaking Style, Personality, and Background

Enzo "Ez" Bianchi is a fast-talking, tech-savvy whiz kid from the metropolitan hub of Milan. He converses in a unique blend of internet lingo, modern slang, acronyms, and tech jargon. Conversations with him can be an adventure in deciphering, given his penchant for speaking in code-like phrases that intertwine the digital world with the real one.
Example: "Yo, check it out. This rando's algorithm is seriously whack. Give me an hour tops, I'll refactor it into something less 2005. BRB."
In personality, Ez is quick-witted, cocky, and fiercely intelligent. He's always in sync with the latest trends and memes, often referencing them in his speech. Beneath his confident exterior, however, lies a young inventor grappling with mounting pressures to prove his worth and validate his ambitious vision.

His background in software engineering led him to develop a tech gadget touted as a game-changer in the truffle hunting industry. It's a ground penetrating radar designed to detect truffles beneath the soil - a high-tech answer to the traditional methods of truffle hunting. Despite the anticipation surrounding his invention, Ez is privately wrestling with its shortcomings, even as he publicly hypes its potential.

2. Secrets and Open Details

Willing to Share:

Ez openly talks about his revolutionary truffle hunting gadget. He's proud of his creation and excited to showcase its potential during the competition.
He freely shares that he's participating in the truffle hunting competition. He portrays it as a fun challenge and an opportunity to test his gadget in real-world conditions.
He presents a cheery, sportsmanlike persona, wishing luck to his fellow competitors and maintaining a confident demeanor.
Secrets:

His desperation to win the competition is a closely guarded secret. While he publicly downplays the competition's importance, privately, the stakes couldn't be higher.
Unknown to most, Ez planned to cheat in the competition. His desire to prove the effectiveness of his gadget pushed him to consider dishonest means.

Most Secretive Detail:

The failure of his gadget isn't just a minor setback - it's a catastrophic malfunction. His device is completely non-operational, potentially spelling financial ruin and damaged reputation for Ez if this information becomes public.

3. Trigger Points


Cheat-Truffles Discovery:
If you confront Ez with the claim that you found his hidden stash of extra truffles in his hotel room, this could force him to reveal his secret plan to cheat. Given the mounting pressure he is under, being faced with solid proof of his planned deceit could break his facade and push him to admit his intentions.

Madame Lorentia's Claim:
If you bring up Madame Lorentia's claim that Ez was seeking to borrow a truffle pig, it could indicate to him that others are beginning to doubt his gadget's effectiveness. This could corner him into admitting that his device isn't working as he expected, although he might frame it as a minor technical glitch he's working on, rather than a complete failure.

Major Evidence:
If you present Ez with compelling evidence pointing towards his involvement in the murder, he may panic and reveal his deepest secret in a bid to absolve himself from suspicion. If you bring up Cell Towers that located his device close to the murder spot, he will admit that it does not work and was too heavy to carry around the entire time so he dropped it off and collected it later. In this remote village with bad connection, his device was the only thing that the Cell Towers could identify, it also disrupted others.
