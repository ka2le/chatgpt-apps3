SHORT RECAP
A murder has been committed in a remote and small Italian village during the annual Truffle Hunting Competition. Lorenzo Bucatini, born in the village, now famous around the world, assisting michelin star chefs with their truffles has been murdered during the truffle hunt in the forest. The backdrop is enchanting, with rolling hills, lush greenery, and snow-capped peaks in the distance. The village's landscapes are adorned with wildflower fields and a vineyard infamous for its disappointing wines. Truffle swines and dogs, essential partners in truffle hunting, navigate the intricate underground networks of fungi beneath the forest floor.
The annual Truffle Hunting Festival is an event that attracts truffle aficionados from all corners.
